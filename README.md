# SASRB - System Administrator Script Recipe Book
I created this repository so that everyone can find the script they need for themselves and their tasks. I ask those visitors who are interested in adding to the repository. Hopefully subcategories will appear here soon. And there will be not only a Linux server, but also a Windows Server. But this is in the future. 
Thanks!
